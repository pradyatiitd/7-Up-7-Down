2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net P1buffer_reg[11]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin P1buffer_reg[11]_i_2/O, cell P1buffer_reg[11]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net P2buffer_reg[11]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin P2buffer_reg[11]_i_2/O, cell P2buffer_reg[11]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net bet_amount_reg[11]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin bet_amount_reg[11]_i_1/O, cell bet_amount_reg[11]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net decide/result_reg_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin decide/result_reg_i_2/O, cell decide/result_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sub/invbet_reg_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sub/invbet_reg_i_1/O, cell sub/invbet_reg_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net sub/p1r_reg[11]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin sub/p1r_reg[11]_i_2/O, cell sub/p1r_reg[11]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLCK-12#1 Warning
Clock Placer Checks  
Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	pushRand_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to W19
	pushRand_IBUF_BUFG_inst (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y1
